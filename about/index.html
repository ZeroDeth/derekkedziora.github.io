<p>Hi, I'm Derek.</p>

<p>I've made Ukraine my home since 2010: first Dnipro, then a village in Lvivska oblast and finally Kyiv. I've also worked two years in China and a year in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>I studied Russian language and literature at Arizona State University and traded my love of foreign languages for a career in teaching my native language.</p>
