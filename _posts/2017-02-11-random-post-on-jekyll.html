<p>I love using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for my blog; a static site generator gives me more or less everything I need without the horror stories of databases and PHP. The coding is simple enough that I can take care of pretty much anything myself.</p>

<p>One of the problems of static site generators is that fun features like linking to a random post are much harder to implement. A little tinkering with Javascript and <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Liquid</a> (Jekyll's templating language), brought the result that I wanted:</p>  

<p><a id="randoLink" href"" target="_blank">View a random post</a>
{% include random-post.html %}</p>

<p>The tick is straightforward: get all the post URLs into a Javascript array, use Javascript to generate a (pseudo)random number (bounded by the number of items in the array) and you have the URL to a random post. </p>

<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/derekkedziora/derekkedziora.github.io/blob/master/_includes/random-post.html" target="_blank">GitHub</a> if you'd like to use it yourself.
