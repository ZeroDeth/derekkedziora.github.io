#### Project Management and Personal Productivity

**Key Concepts**  
- How is workflow and productivity managed at your company?   
- Is this system <u>domain specific</u> or not?  
- Can professional project management systems be applied to your personal life?  

**Main Activity**   
Set a strict time limit (15 minutes to 30 minutes) for yourself to research Scrum or Agile methodology.

It is important to stop once your time is up. Your goal is to do the most you can within your timeframe. Make a note of what your <u>stumbling blocks</u> were.

Our class will be a <u>retrospective</u> to discuss your stumbling blocks, how to get around them and the content of your research. 

The Wikipedia article about [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) is a good place to start, but don't limit yourself to it. 

If you are already familiar with this approach, there are many others out there such as [the OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) or [the Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System). You can also look at some popular personal task management systems such as [GTD](https://hamberg.no/gtd/). 

**Reflection Questions**  
- What makes a productivity system work or not work?  
- How can the ideas that you read about be implemented either personally or professionally?
