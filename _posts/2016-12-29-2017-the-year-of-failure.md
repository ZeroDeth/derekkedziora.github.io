title: "2017: the Year of Failure"

I've found an upbeat way to focus on the start of 2017; I'm going to obsessively focus on failure. My entire twenties have been devoted to either learning or teaching languages, and I'm walking away from the experience profoundly frustrated: little of my studies prepared me for using a foreign language outside of the classroom and I've watch my students needlessly falter and stagnate.

Over the course of the year, I plan to analyze these categories of failure in more depth:

- Zeno's Paradox: the upper-intermediates and advanced students who make precisely the same mistakes today as they did a year ago
- Natural versus Correct: why the former matters even though nearly every textbook focuses exclusively on the latter
- Parkinson's Bike Shed: we correct, focus on and teach topics that are easy but relatively unimportant (the "th" sound, for instance) rather than issues that are complex yet critical (using modal verbs properly)
- Is the in-company class a perk or does it fill a business need: why most in-company programs are doomed to failure
- London is the Capital of Great Britain: learning unnatural and rarely used phrases, words and grammatical structures leads to stilted English

As I step away from the daily grind of teaching, this is the direction I'm taking the blog. Stay tuned.
