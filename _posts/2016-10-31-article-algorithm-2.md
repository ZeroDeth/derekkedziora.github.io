## The Article Algorithm, Part Deux

Compare your algorithm to your intuition. Where did you get different answers?

Here are some possible answers:  
[0] ø  
[1] a  
[2] the  
[3] a, ø    
[4] a  
[5] ø, a  
[6] the, ø  
[7] the    
[8] ø  
[9] a, ø  
[10] the  
[11] the  
[12] the  

**Conclusions**  
Articles serve two main purposes in English: to <u>classify</u> or <u>identify</u>.

When we <u>classify</u>, we say that something is part of a group but either we don't know which particular instance of that group it is or that information isn't relevant. This information must be understood by both the speaker and the listener.  

*I saw a movie yesterday.*  
  
The listener doesn't know which movie the speaker saw, while the speaker is placing more emphasis on the movie as a class rather than a particular film.  

When we <u>identify</u>, we place our emphasis on a particular instance from a group.    

*I saw the new horror movie yesterday.*  

Both speaker and listener are positive which movie is being spoken of. On the other hand if there are many new horror movies and the particular one isn't important to the conversation:  

*I saw a new horror movie yesterday.*    

Thus we can see that there are many cases when it simply isn't possible to use a mechanical set of rules to guess the appropriate article as it ultimately depends more on semantics rather than syntax. In fact, we ignore the classical rules of not using articles with proper nouns or uncountable nouns when marking the difference between <u>classifying</u> and <u>identify</u> is important. 

There are some fairly stable phrases such as "at [ø] home" and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocative_case" target="_blank">the vocative case</a> also never takes an article.  Otherwise, it is important to look at the semantics of each case rather than only the syntax.
