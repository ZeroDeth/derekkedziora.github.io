## The Article Algorithm, Part Deux

Use this text to test your algorithm:  

<pre>
"Good morning, [0] ____ guys. What [1] ____ great day!"
"Yeah, just [2] ____ kind of day we needed after so many cloudy days."

"Have you had [3] ____ coffee yet?"  
"No, I'm making [4] ____ cup right now." 
"You take it black?" 
"No, I have it with [5] ____ sugar."
"What do you think, is [6] ____ coffee better in [7] ____ office or at [8] ____ home?" 

"By the way, [9] ____ Jack Taylor was looking for you."
"[10] ____ one who called yesterday?" 
"[11] ___ receptionist talked to him. I think he's [12] ____ Jack Taylor we worked with last year."
</pre>

Compare your algorithm to your intuition. Where did you get different answers?

<--- 

Here are some possible answers:  
[0] ø  
[1] a  
[2] the  
[3] a, any  
[4] a  
[5] ø, a  
[6] the, ø  
[7] the  
[8] ø  
[9] a, ø  
[10] the  
[11] the  
[12] the  

**Conclusions**  
Articles serve two main purposes in English: to <u>classify</u> or <u>identify</u>.

When we <u>classify</u>, we say that something is part of a group but either we don't know which particular instance of that group it is or that information isn't relevant. This information must be understood by both the speaker and the listener.  
*I saw a movie yesterday.* 
The listener doesn't know which movie the speaker saw, while the speaker is placing more emphasis on the movie as a class rather than a paticular film. 

When we <u>indentify</u>, we place our emphasis on a particular instance from a group.  
*I saw the new horror movie yesterday.*
Both speaker and listener are positive which movie is being spoken of. On the other hand if they are many new horror movies and the particular one isn't important to the conversation:  
*I saw a new horror movie yesterday.*  

Thus we can see that there are many cases shen it simply isn't possible to use a mechanical set of rules to guess the appropriate article as it ultimately depends more on semantics rather than syntax. In fact, we ignore the classical rules of not using articles with proper nouns or uncountable nouns when marking the difference between <u>classifying</u> and <u>indentify</u> is important.
