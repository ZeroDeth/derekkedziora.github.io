**Key Concepts**  
- If you already speak English, is there any point in learning another language? 
- Why do something or acquire a skill that is "useless"?  

**Keywords**  
take over (took, taken, phrasal verb)  
why bother [to do / doing], (set phrase)  
fraught, fraught with s/th (adj.)  
worldview (countable noun)  
dementia (uncountable noun)  
diligent (adj.)  
blow [your] mind (blew, blown, phrasal verb)  

**Main Activity**  
Listen to [this TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/john_mcwhorter_4_reasons_to_learn_a_new_language) to evaluate John McWorther's argument for learning languages. As a bonus, catch a grammatical "mistake" he makes. What do such mistakes tell you about English? 

<!--- 
Mistake one: "me either" is used without clear negation in the previous sentence. "Me neither" would have sounded better. 

Mistake two: mixing up lie and lay. The vast majority of native speakers use them as absolute synonyms.

**Reflection Questions**  
- What four arguments does the speaker make for learning languages? 
- How strong are his arguments?
- Which language would be worth learning besides English?
