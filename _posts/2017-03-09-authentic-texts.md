Spending the month of March in the US has given me the chance to see some authentic English again. 

One of the first points that jumped out at me is that native isn't always better: 

![It is not recommended to dispose any liquid other than water in the sink](/files/images/img001-sink-instructions.jpg "Sink Instructions")

Given that I saw this in the lavatory on a domestic flight in the US, I'm willing to assume it was written by an American. It goes to show that clear writing isn't a native vs. non-native thing. 

Does this mean you can pour liquids other than water down the sink or not? What is the issue - heat damaging the plumbing or oils causing clogs?

I'd prefer to make things simple with some variation on this theme:
>Water only. No other liquids in the sink. 

Here's an example modal verbs being used naturally: 

![If clogging should occur...Starch should begin to spray](/files/images/img002-starch-label.jpg "Starch Instructions")

Directions are given with the imperative and conditional. 

The first time should is used, it is a conditional marker. The second time it is used, it is a prediction market. Should is never used for commands or advice. Can is used to show possibility rather adverbs. 

This is the natural and beautiful English that is so hard to capture for non-native speakers of Western European languages.
