I keep coming back to the point that language learning needs to be intense to be effective. I've found that learning vocabulary outside of European languages requires a level of focus and effort that I don't need for Russian or German.

Lately, I've been experimenting with studying Pāli and Thai, neither of which are particularly familiar to a native English speaker - the Indoeuropean roots of Pāli notwithstanding.  

Enter [Anki][https://apps.ankiweb.net] (free as a desktop and web app).  This is a neat tool for learning vocabulary. I need two ten-minute-ish chunks a day for my vocabulary acquisition to shoot way up. Those ten minutes will definitely be deliberate practice - meaning not particularly fun, but increasing your *active* vocabulary brings rewards of its own.
