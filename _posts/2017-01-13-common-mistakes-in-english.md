Here's the start of my series of posts about common mistakes that I hear in English. They aren't arranged in any particular order. Sentences in *italics* are correct unless there is an *!exclamation mark* in front of it.

## bring / take

Bring always shows motion towards the speaker, while take shows motion going away from the speaker.

*My wife told me to <u>take</u> an umbrella with me when I left for work.*        

*Since it rained, I was glad that I had <u>brought</u> my umbrella to the office.* (I'm still at work)   

*It's a good thing I <u>took</u> my umbrella to work today.* (I'm no longer at work)  

Note that "with you" can be dropped when it is abundantly clear from context.

## go / come / get

Similarly, <u>come</u> shows movement relative to the speaker's position. <u>Get</u> is used to show completed motion. I don't have statistics to back this up, but I generally think of using location (I'm already at work) as more common than motion (I've already arrived at / <u>got to</u> / made it to work).

<u>Come</u>: motion towards the speaker  
<u>Go</u>: general motion  
<u>Get</u>: completed motion  

*I <u>came</u> to work at 9 AM this morning* (I'm still at work)

*I <u>go</u> to work everyday*

*I <u>got</u> to work at 9 AM this morning* (I'm no longer at work)

An easy trick is to put "here" in any sentence with <u>come</u>. If it doesn't fit, use <u>get</u> or <u>go</u>.

## by / until

Я буду в Киеве до пятницы.  
*I'll be in Kiev <u>until</u> Friday*  

<u>Until</u> shows how long an action is going to take place.

Мне надо доделать этот проект до пятницы.    
*I have to finish the project <u>by</u> Friday.*  

<u>By</u> is used with deadlines.

## feel (myself)

We never use <u>feel myself</u> with an adjective.

*I <u>feel</u> ~~myself~~ tired.*

We can use <u>feel myself</u> with a gerund.

*I was so tired that I could <u>feel myself</u> falling asleep.*

## make / do a mistake  

We <u>make mistakes</u>. We never do mistakes.

## Общение с собеседником про знакомых

**Don't** translate this as:

*!Communication with an interlocutor regarding acquaintances.*

Communication is an abstract concept. Jane Austen was the last native English speaker to use the word interlocutor. Acquaintance is a stiff and cold word.

This sounds much more natural:

*Talking to somebody about people we know.*

## I / we, and / with

We don't have doppelgängers in English. The same person can't appear in both subject and the object of a sentence.  

*!We discussed with you...* can be a ménage à trois but not a tête-à-tête.  

Likewise, *My friend and I...* is correct. We never say *!We (or I) with my friend*. In many dialects of spoken English *Me and my friend* is common, but it's rare in written English.

## borrow / lend

*I borrowed money from the bank.*  
*The bank lent (loaned) me money.*

## explain to me

<u>Explain</u> requires a direct object.

*The CEO <u>explained</u> the new product (direct object) to us (indirect object).*

We can't drop the direct object, and the indirect object requires to.

My psychologist is the only one who can <u>explain me</u>.   

## I don't know why my students make this mistake

Nine times out of ten, I'd hear:

*!I don't know why do my students make this mistake.*

This isn't a question; drop the do.

Also watch out for the word order change:

*I don't know what time it is.*
