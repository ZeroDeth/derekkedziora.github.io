Here's the start of my series of posts about common mistakes that I hear in English. They aren't arranged in any particular order. Sentences in *italics* are correct unless there is an *!exclamation mark* in front of it.

## 1. bring / take

Bring always shows motion towards the speaker, while take shows motion going away from the speaker.

*My wife told me to <u>take</u> an umbrella with me when I left for work.*      
*Since it rained, I was glad that I had <u>brought</u> my umbrella to the office.* (I'm still at work)  
*It's a good thing I <u>took</u> my umbrella to work today.* (I'm no longer at work)  

Note that "with you" can be dropped when it is abundantly clear from context.

## 2. go / come / get

Similarly, come shows movement relative to the speaker's position. Get is used to show completed motion. I don't have statistics to back this up, but I generally think of using location (I'm already at work) as more common than motion (I've already arrived at / got to / made it to work).

Come: motion towards the speaker  
Go: general motion  
Get: completed motion  

An easy trick is to put "here" in any sentence with come. If it doesn't fit, use get or go.

## 3. by / until

Я буду в Киеве до пятницы.
*I'll be in Kiev until Friday*  

<u>Until</u> shows how long an action is going to take place.

*Мне надо доделать этот проект до пятницы.*  
I have to finish the project by Friday.  

<u>By</u> is used with deadlines.

## 4. Feel myself + adjective

We never use feel myself with an adjective.

*I feel tired.*

We can use feel myself with a gerund.

*I was so tired that I could feel myself falling asleep.*

## 5. Make a mistake  

We <u>make mistakes</u>; we never do mistakes.

## 6. Общение с собеседником про знакомых

Please don't translate this as:

*!Communication with an interlocutor regarding acquaintances.*

Communication is an abstract concept. Jane Austen was the last native English speaker to use the word interlocutor. Acquaintance is a stiff and cold word.

This sounds much more natural:

*Talking to somebody about people we know.*

## 7. I / we; and / with (as a subject)

We don't have doppelgängers in English. The same person can't appear in both subject and the object of a sentence.  

*!We discussed with you...* can be a ménage à trois but not a tête-à-tête.  

Likewise, *My friend and I...* is correct. We never say *!We (or I) with my friend*. In many dialects of spoken English *Me and my friend* is common, but it's rare in written English.

## 8. borrow / lend

*I borrowed money from the bank.*  
*The bank lent (loaned) me money.*

## 9. Explain to me

Explain requires a direct object.

*The CEO explained the new product (direct object) to us (indirect object).*

We can't drop the direct object, and the indirect object requires to.

My psychologist is the only one who can "explain me".   

## 10. I don't know why my students make this mistake

Nine times out of ten, I'd hear:

*!I don't know why do my students make this mistake.*

This isn't a question; drop the do.

Also watch out for the word order change:

*I don't know what time it is.*
