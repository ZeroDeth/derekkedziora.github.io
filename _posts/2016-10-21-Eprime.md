description: "Remove the verb to be from your speaking and writing to improve clarity"
---
[Robert Anton Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson) helped popularize the idea of English Prime, which removes the verb "to be" from standard English.

- What would change in the organization of ideas and thinking upon the removal of "to be" from your language?

The main benefit that Wilson and others see from using English Prime comes now stark constrast between absolute truth and subject experience. Compare:  
<blockquote>Coffee is wonderful.</blockquote> 
vs.   
<blockquote>I enjoy drinking coffee because it is warm and the energetic feeling it gives me.</blockquote> 

Even Hamlet could have improved the clarity of his monologue:
<blockquote>To live or to die,
I ask myself this.</blockquote>

- In what cases do you think this authors and speakers would find this approach useful?
- When would users of the language find this too cumbersome to use? 

Have a look at the aricle at [RationalWiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/E-Prime) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime) about English Prime.
