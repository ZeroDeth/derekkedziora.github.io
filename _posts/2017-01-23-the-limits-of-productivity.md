This is the first in my series of in-depth lessons that I mentioned in my previous blog post.

## How to Use This

The best way to approach to this type of lesson is to find a group and work through it together.

1. Write a 140-character description or comment for each article, a hundred-word email on how to implement an idea from the topic and a three hundred word essay on your overall impression of the topic.

2. Exchange your writing with someone in the group for editing and feedback.

3. Meet for a discussion of the topic and the linguistic difficulties that you faced in working through it.

Before you dive into the reading, remember to not use [Google Translate mode][0], fully analyze the argument of the source and only then develop your own response to the text.

## The Topic: the Limits of Productivity

Robert Gorden's [The Rise and Fall of American Growth][1] (affiliate link) is the nucleus that the rest of the articles revolve around. Far from the techno-utopian vision of Silicon Valley, Gordon argues that the tech revolution is hyped and that the great age of economic growth in the developed world is over.

## The Source List

1. Let's start off with an article from *the Economist* showing that productivity growth has been anemic across developed economies: [The Curious Case of Missing Global Productivity Growth][2].

2. The second part of the first article presents a different argument that blames established companies for the economy becoming non-productive: [Attack of the Zombie Firms][3].

3. [G Force][4] is the original book review of *The Rise and Fall of American Growth* in *the Economist*.

4. *Aeon* takes the same topic in an altogether different direction: most of the labor in an economy is devoted to the maintenance of infrastructure rather than innovation. [Hail the Maintainers][5] is provocative and iconoclastic.

5. No look at techno-skepticism would be complete without due homage to Peter Thiel. [Dan Wang][6] provides a cogent summary of Thiel's philosophy.

6. At first glance this seems irrelevant, but [Why Generation Y Yuppies are Unhappy][7] delves into psychological reasons that younger people are deeply dissatisfied despite living in world that is unimaginably better off than that of their grandparents.
