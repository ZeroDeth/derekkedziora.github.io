Should is one of the most misused words by non-native speakers and can instantly make your language sound rude, condescending or just plain unnatural. 

Here's where I'd avoid using should:

### Giving directions

Let's say a recruiter needs to tell a candidate how to find the office: 

[0.a] *<i>You should take the metro to our office.</i>

[1.a] *<i>You should get off at Kontraktova Ploshcha.</i>

Instead, give raw information and reasons: 

[0.b] <i>We don't have a lot of parking near the office, so it is easier to take the metro than drive here.</i>

[1.b] <i>Kontraktova Ploshcha is the closest metro station</i> 

### Procedures 

[2.a] *<i>I should pass the exam to get a driver's license</i>

In this case there is no choice. If I don't pass the exam, there's no way I'll get a license. <i>Supposed to</i>, <i>ought to</i> and <i>should</i> all carry a sense of choice, whereas <i>must</i>, <i>have to</i> and <i>need to</i> show that there is no choice. 

[2.b] <i>I need to pass the exam to get a driver's license.</i>

### Requests 

If something is a true request, don't use should. 

[3.a] *<i>You should call me back by the end of the week.</i>

This sounds rather rude. A much more neutral sounding request would be: 

[3.b] <i>Could you call me back by the end of the week?</i>

You can add a reason to make the request more urgent: 

[3.c] <i>Please let me know by the end of the week so I can process your order on time.</i>

### Predictions 

The most common place to properly use should is with predictions. This part of the larger system of  <a href="http://derek.com.ua/lessons/modal-probability" target="_blank">evidentiality in English.</a> 

[4.a] <i>It should snow tomorrow.</i>

[4.b] <i>It's a bit too warm; it shouldn't snow tomorrow.</i>

[5.a] <i>I should be on time, since traffic isn't bad.</i>

Sentence [5.a] usually wouldn't be negated. Instead: 

[5.b] <i>Traffic is bad today; I'm going to (will) be late.</i>

### Impersonal Obligations 

While I'd avoid using <i>should</i> for a personal obligation, it is useful to talk about more general social obligations. The first person singular is often used: 

[6.a] <i>We should consider alternatives to our current strategy.</i>

It's still possible to not use <i>should</i> in this context: 

[6.b] <i>Let's look at some alternatives to our current strategy.</i>

When you is used, make sure it is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_you" target="_blank>impersonal you</a>. This can be tricky in English as context is the only way to distinguish these, whereas in other languages such as German the difference is much more marked: 

[7.a.de] Du sollst deine Hausaufgaben machen. 

[7.b.de] Man soll seine Hausaufgaben machen. 

We can translate this impersonally as: 

[7.b.en] <i>You should do your homework.</i>

### Personal Advice 

This is a danger zone and using should here often comes off rather rude. While we could use <i>should</i>, it would best be reserved for a parent or teacher scolding a child. 

[7.a.en.1] <i>Please do your homework.</i> 

It's even better to use a conditional for personal advice: 

[7.a.en.2] <i>You'll remember the material better if you do the homework.</i>

### Questions 

Yes or no questions can be asked using should. 

[8.a] <i>Should I open the window?</i> 

Another structure that works just as well: 

[8.b] <i>Would you like me to open the window?</i>

### Regrets 

[9] <i>I should have eaten breakfast this morning.<i>

[10] <i>My friend shouldn't have traveled to Asia, because he got very sick.</i> 

### Conclusion 

<i>Should</i> can be tricky to use without sounding a bit rude. In most cases, you are better off avoiding it altogether. The imperative plus please is perfectly polite. <i>Could you</i> also works for requests. 

If you do use should, stick to the first person or third person. It's best to use the general you instead of a personal you with should. 

The best advice is to observe how native speakers use modal verbs. Pick a podcast or blog post that uses the word and analyze how it is used. Adopt the same usage yourself.
