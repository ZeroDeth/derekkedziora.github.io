## The Article Algorithm: to the or to a

**Introduction**  

- What function do articles serve in English? 
- What structures serve similar functions in your language?

**Create an Article (or is it the article?) Algorithm**  
Use your previous learning experience to make a flow chart to help you decide which article ([ø], [a],[an] or [the]) to use with any given noun phrase. 

Some concepts that may help:   
proper noun [Los Angeles], common noun [city]  
countable [phone, phones], uncountable [water]  
membership in a group, uniqueness   
consonant [b, c, d], vowel [a, e, i]  
noun [man], noun phrase [tall man], pronoun [he]  
singular [backpack], plural [backpacks]  

**[ø] ? Testing Phase**  
Make up some of your own examples or use a text from a trustworthy publication to test your algorithm.
