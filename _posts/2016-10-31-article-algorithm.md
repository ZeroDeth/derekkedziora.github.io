## The Article Algorithm: to the or to a

**Introduction**  

- What function do articles serve in English? 
- What structures serve similar functions in your language?

**Create an Article (or is it the article?) Algorithm**  
Use your previous learning experience to make a flow chart to help you decide which article ([Ã¸], [a],[an] or [the]) to use with any given noun phrase. 

Some concepts that may help:   
proper noun [Los Angeles], common noun [city]  
countable [phone, phones], uncountable [water]  
membership in a group, uniqueness   
consonant [b, c, d], vowel [a, e, i]  
noun [man], noun phrase [tall man], pronoun [he]  
singular [backpack], plural [backpacks]  

**The Test**  
Use this text to test your algorithm. 
<pre>
"Hey [0] ____ man, What [1] ____ great day!"
"Yeah, just [2] ____ kind of day we needed after so many cloudy days."

"Have you had [3] ____ coffee yet?"  
"No, I'm making [4] ____ cup right now." 
"You take it black?" 
"No, I'll have it with [5] ____ sugar."
"What do you think, is [6] ____ coffee better in [7] ____ office or at [8] ____ home?" 

"By the way, [9] ____ Jack Taylor was looking for you."
"[10] ____ one who called yesterday?" 
"[11] ___ receptionist talked to him. I think he's [12] ____ Jack Taylor we worked with last year."
