### Pre-activity Questions   

- What function do articles serve in English? 
- What structures serve similar functions in your language?

### Main Activity 

Use your previous learning experience to make an algorithm to help you decide which article ([Ã¸], [a],[an] or [the]) to use with any given noun phrase. 

Some concepts that may help:   
proper noun [Los Angeles], common noun [city]  
countable [phone, phones], uncountable [water]  
membership in a group, uniqueness   
consonant [b, c, d], vowel [a, e, i]  
noun [man], noun phrase [tall man], pronoun [he]  
singular [backpack], plural [backpacks]  


### Test Your Algorithm 
<p>"Hey [0] ____ man, what [1] ____ great day!"<br>
"Yeah, just [2] ____ kind of day we needed after so many cloudy days."</P>

<p>"Have you had [3] ____ coffee yet?"<br>
"No, I'm making [4] ____ cup right now."<br> 
"You take it black?" <br>
"No, I'll have it with [5] ____ sugar."<br>
"What do you think, is [6] ____ coffee better in [7] ____ office or at [8] ____ home?"</p> 

<p>"By the way, [9] ____ Jack Taylor was looking for you."<br>
"[10] ____ one who called yesterday?"<br>
"[11] ___ receptionist talked to him. I think he's [12] ____ Jack Taylor we worked with last year."</p>
