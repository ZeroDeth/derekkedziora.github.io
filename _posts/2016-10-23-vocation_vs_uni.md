#### Vocational Education vs. University Education 

**Key Concepts**   
- What is the purpose of education in general and attending university in particular?   
- What are the advantages of vocational education?   
- What are the limits of vocational education?  

**Keywords**  
college: in American English this usually means university  
vocational training (noun phrase)  
opt for s/th (regular verb)  
small potatoes (set expression)  
churn out (regular verb)  
backbone of s/th (noun phrase)  
apprentice (personal noun), apprenticeship (noun)  
s/th wouldn't fly (set expression)  

**Main Activity**  
Read [this article](http://world.time.com/2012/10/04/who-needs-college-the-swiss-opt-for-vocational-school/) from *Time Magazine* about vocational training in Switzerland to answer the reflection questions.  

**Reflection Questions**  
1. If you had the choice between massive student debt or a low-cost vocational program, which would you choose?  
2. Should the Swiss model be exported to other countries?  
3. Does a university education actually prepare a person for a modern knowledge-based job? 

**Supplementary Materials**  
Mike Rowe's [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs) on the lack of skilled labor in the US contains many similar ideas.
