title: Adjectives with -ing and -ed
description: Is your English Teacher Bored, Boring or Both?
permalink: blog/:title

Most English adjectives that describe an emotional experience have two possible endings: *ing* or *ed*.

Let's take the idea of *interest*:

1. The book *interests* me. (verb)  
2. I'm *interested* in the book. (the experiencer: -ed)    
3. The book is *interesting*. (the source of the experience: -ing)  

The experiencer is always marked with an -ed adjective, while the source of the experience is marked with an -ing adjective. Generally, inanimate objects can only take -ing.

Animate objects can take either -ing or -ed adjectives. Hence, the teacher could be boring if the students are about to fall asleep, or the teacher could be bored if he has taught this very lesson a hundred times already!

Looking at our example again:

4. The book [source] interests [emotion] me [experiencer]  
5. [source] [to be] [emotion]+ing  
6. [experiencer] [to be] [emotion]+ed  

If you are ever in doubt, rephrase your sentence with a verb instead of an adjective; the word order will always tell you whether the adjective should take an -ed or -ing ending.
