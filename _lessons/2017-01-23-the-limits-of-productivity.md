Robert Gorden's [The Rise and Fall of American Growth][1] is the nucleus that the rest of the articles revolve around. Far from the a techno-utopian vision of the future, Gordon argues that the tech revolution is hyped and that the great age of economic growth in the developed world is over.

**The Reading List**

1. Let's start off with an article from *the Economist* showing that productivity growth has been anemic across developed economies: [The Curious Case of Missing Global Productivity Growth][2].
2. The second part of the first article presents a different argument that blames established companies for the economy becoming non-productive: [Attack of the Zombie Firms][3].
3. [G Force][4] is *the Economist's* original book review of *The Rise and Fall of American Growth*.
4. [Hail the Maintainers][5] takes the same topic in an altogether different direction: most of the labor in an economy is devoted to the maintenance of infrastructure rather than innovation.
