Flow is the psychological state of intense concentration popularized by Mihaly Czikszsentmihaly. Here’s a [five minute crash course][0].
 
Our topic centers around the main ideas from the two books:

 *Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World*
 
 [Twenty-minute overview][1]  
 [Interview with Cal Newport][2]
 
 *The Rise of Superman: Decoding the Science of Ultimate Human Performance*

**Ideas to start the discussion**

1. Flow is simply a natural process and neutral.
2. Companies, schools and governments should foster flow states that are productive.
3. Dissatisfaction with work and low productivity come from not creating working conditions conducive to flow or deep work.
4. What can be done on an individual level to increase flow?
5. Deep work isn’t applicable to me.
6. Flow is an addiction.
