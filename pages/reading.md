Here's what I read on my day to day basis. <!-- My recommendation list for books is here. --> 

Email and RSS subscriptions are the way to go. I set up a separate folder in my email for subscriptions and disable notifications. 

### News 

I've always been a news junkie even though I'd like to break the habit somewhat. Getting away from the 'always need to know first' syndrome is difficult. I try to limit myself to a [daily email][0] from the *New York Times* and a-once-a-week look at *[The Economist][1]*. The more I've removed myself from constantly checking the news, the better informed I am.  

My daily rabbit hole is [Hacker News][3]. This is the one place on the internet where the comments are worth reading and stuff is informative without the partisan buzz.
