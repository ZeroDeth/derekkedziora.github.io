Here's what I read on a day to day basis. <!-- For my all-time favorite reads, see my book list.[0] -->

## News

Getting out of the constant news cycle has made me far more relaxed and sane. Now I blithely miss out on the latest fake news crises.

The New York Times [daily email][1] provides more than enough information each morning in a five-minute read.

I read most of [the Economist][2] each week for in-depth coverage.


## Blogs and Podcasts

Although irredeemably hokey at times, [the Art of Manliness][3] offers some great content and insightful podcasts.

Cal Newport's blog, [Study Hacks][4], is a voice crying out in the wilderness against the culture of distraction and frivolity.
