Here's what I read on a day to day basis. <!-- For my all-time favorite reads, see my book list.[0] -->

## News

Getting out of the 24/7 news cycle is critical for sanity and stepping back from the poor quality journalism of the whole fake news phenomenon. 

The New York Times [daily email][1] gives what you need to know about the world in five to ten minutes. 

I read most of [the Economist][2] each week for in-depth coverage. 

My daily time waster and procrastination rabbit hole is [Hacker News][3], which has some of the best comments online and is mostly a-political. 

## Blogs

Although hokey, [the Art of Manliness][4] offers some great content and neat podcasts. 

[J.D. Moyer's blog][5] is like Tim Ferriss and Dave Asprey without the sales pitch and is more doable for regular people. [Five Things That Made My Life 10% Better (Each)][6] is a great read.

Cal Thomas' Blog, [Study Hacks][7], is a 'cry of the soul' against the culture of distraction and frivolity.
