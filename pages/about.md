I call Ukraine home, although I'm a native of Phoenix, Arizona. I've spent most of my adult life teaching English in China, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. I currently work as a marketing editor at an IT company in Kiev.  

Here's my [online CV][0] and my CV as a [PDF][1].

This is what I'm up to [now][2].

I'm never far from something read: this is my [regular reading list][3].
<!-- Here is my [book list][4] -->

### Language

Iâ€™m a language geek. I've learned Russian to fluency and studied a smattering of a few other languages. I teach, write and elicit natural and functional language - [linguistic platonism][plato-post] is my nemesis.

### Core Philosophy

Philosophy makes me tick: from the pragmatism of the stoics to the ideals of early Buddhism, there's a lot of ancient wisdom from which to carve out a meaningful life in the modern world. I dabble in health, fitness and positive psychology with a paleo-inspired diet, barefoot running, cold showers and trying to center life around [flow states][5].

### About this blog

I started this site in 2016 as a way to share lesson plans with my students. These original posts are still up in the [lesson archives][6] section. In 2017, I changed course to focus more on general topics in language learning and teaching.

### Copyright

I release all the content on this site to the public domain under the [creative commons zero license][7] and the code under the [MIT License][8].

I made this blog with [Jekyll][9] and host it on [GitHub Pages][10]. You can view [my code on GitHub][11]. Feel free to fork this site and use it as a template for your own blog.
