These days, I call Ukraine home, although I'm a native of Phoenix, Arizona. I've spent most of my adult life teaching English in China, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. I'm currently working as an editor at an IT company in Kiev.  

Here's my [online CV][0] or you can download it as a [PDF][1].

Here's what I'm doing [now][2]. <!-- , what I [use][3] and what I [regularly read][4]. -->

### Language

I’m a language geek. I've learned Russian to fluency and studied a smattering a few other languages. I’m all about natural, functional language. Linguistic platonism is my nemesis.

### Core Philosophy

Philosophy makes me tick: from the pragmatism of the stoics to the ideals of early Buddhism, there's a lot of ancient wisdom from which to carve out a meaningful life in the modern world. The paleo movement has a lot of great ideas from a high-fat diet, to barefoot running, cold showers and trying to center life around [flow states][5]. <!-- Here is my [reading list][4] -->

### About this blog

I started this site in 2016 as a way to share lesson plans with my students. These original posts are still up in the [lesson archives][6] section. In 2017, I’m changing course a bit to focus more on general topics in language learning and teaching.
