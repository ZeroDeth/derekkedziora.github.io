## Hipster Style Pages

What I'm doing [now][0], things I [use][1], what I [regularly read][2] and  my [favorite books][3].

## My Story

I've had the good fortune to spend nearly my entire adult life traveling across Asia and Europe, teaching and working with language, and studying what I have a passion for such as languages, philosophy and technology.

Over the past few years, I've become especially interested in Buddhism, mediation, health and fitness, voraciously reading, finding flow states and a modern take on minimalism.  

I grew up in Arizona but have settled in Ukraine for now. Between the two, I've made long stops in Kyrgyzstan, China and Saudi Arabia.

## This blog

I started this site in 2016 as a way to share lessons with my students and teach myself a bit of programming.

I made this site with [Jekyll][4] and host it on [GitHub Pages][5]. You can view [my code on GitHub][6]. Feel free to fork this site and use it as a template for your own blog. I release all the content on this site to the public domain under the [creative commons zero license][7] and the code under the [MIT License][8].
