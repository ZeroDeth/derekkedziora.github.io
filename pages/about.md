# About Me 
I'm a language nerd. Besides English, I speak fluent Russian and have dabbled in Ukrainian, Chinese, German and Spanish.

My teaching style is all about using English in a functional way that sounds natural. If theory and abstract grammar don't serve the greater good of actually using the language, you won't find them in my classes. 

Programming has become my newest hobby; this site is a testament to what I've been able to learn. 

I'm into optimal living, whatever that means. I take it to mean a mostly paleo-diet, lots of low-intensity exercise and trying to avoid chronic stress while inducing randomized acute stress.

Practical philosophy is what makes me tick. I love reading, meditation and trying out new ideas. I'm never far from a book or some thought experiment.
