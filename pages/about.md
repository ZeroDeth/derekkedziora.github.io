## Me

**[language]** I’m a language geek. I teach English, have learned Russian and work as an editor and content writer. I’m all about natural, functional language. Linguistic platonism is my nemesis.

**[lifestyle]** My life revolves around flow states: meditation, challenging bike rides, constantly learning new things and work that requires concentration. Work hard; play hard. Cold showers, random fasting. I love experimenting on myself.

**[global nomad]** I grew up in Arizona and am currently based in Kiev, Ukraine. Between the two, I’ve lived in Kyrgyzstan, China, Saudi Arabia, Dnipro and a Western Ukrainian village.

**[philosophy]** Stoicism and Theravada Buddhism form my philosophical framework.

## About this blog

I started this in 2016 as a way to distribute lessons to my students. These are still up in my <a href="/lesson-archives/">lesson archives</a>. In 2017, I’m changing course a bit to focus more on general topics in language learning and teaching.
