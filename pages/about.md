# About Me
I'm a language nerd. Besides English, I speak Russian and have dabbled in Ukrainian, Chinese, German and Spanish.

My teaching style is all about using English in a functional and natural sounding way. If theory and abstract grammar don't serve the purpose of actually using the language, you won't find them in my classes.

I'm into optimal living. I take that to mean a mostly paleo-diet, lots of low-intensity exercise and trying to avoid chronic stress while inducing randomized acute stress. Nonetheless, I'm hopelessly addicted to coffee and tea.

Practical philosophy is what makes me tick. I love reading, meditation and trying out new ideas. I'm never far from a book or some thought experiment.

Programming has become my newest hobby; this site is a testament to what I've been able to learn.
