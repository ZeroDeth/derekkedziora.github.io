*May 2017*

I've been back in Ukraine for a month now, and am finally hitting the sweet spot at my new-ish job. Being a full-time editor and part-time teacher has proven to be the right choice for now.

I've been using the [Wim Hof Method][0] both for cold showers and to help with my migraines. 

My big side project has been putting together a business. Within the next few months, I should be ready to unveil it.
