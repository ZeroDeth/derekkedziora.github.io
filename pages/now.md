## March 2017

I'm spending the month in Phoenix, Arizona. It's refreshing to take a break from Ukraine and visit family and friends. 

The relative warmth means it's time to start running, swimming and otherwise exercising outside again. 

I'm working on learning more front-end development with [HTML & CCS][0] and [Javascript & jQuery][1] (affiliate links).

Rummaging through my parents' house, I found an Old English textbook. That's my language-geek entertainment for the next month. 

Being home saps my time for extra projects, so I probably won't get around to much until I'm back in Kiev come April.
