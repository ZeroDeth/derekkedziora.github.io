## February 2017

Inspired by [Derek Sivers][0], here is my now page.

I'm still working on teaching myself computational thinking using [An Introduction to Formal Logic][1] and [The Foundations of Mathematics][2].

I've started a new career as an editor and am somewhat frantically learning the ropes of online marketing.

I still have a small group of advanced students that I'm using a test group to develop a better program to break through learning plateaus. Eventually, I hope to expand this into a larger program that depends more on peer to peer interaction than a teacher.

I'm taking a break from living languages and am trying to improve my [PƒÅli][3].

I've ordered [Javascript & jQuery][4]; learning enough Javascript to add some improved functionality to the site is in order.

I'm anxiously awaiting warmer weather so I can get back to running, cycling and otherwise spending more time outside.

Here are affiliate links to the above mentioned books if you'd like to support my site: 

- [An Introduction to Formal Logic][5]
- [The Foundations of Mathematics][6]
- [Javascript & jQuery][7]
