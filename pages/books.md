In progress :) 

<!-- 

Perhaps it is a sign of the times, but for a book list, this is strangely short of books. Instead, I've collected ideas, lectures, digital media and a few books. 

## Meditation and Buddhism 

[Thanissaro Bhikkhu's recommendations][0] are a logical place to start. The short guided meditations are suitable for beginners and seasoned meditators alike. His books and talks range from the practical to the scholarly. 

The [Thai Forrest Sangha][1] in the lineage of Ajahn Chah has a vast collection of short talks, guided meditations and books.

[Ajahn Buddhadasa's][2] book on breath meditation is a wonderful guide to the [Anapanasati Sutta][3]. 

## The Black Swan and Antifragile 

[Taleb][4] somehow touches on economics, risk, deadlifting, art, war and pretty much everything else under the sun. A lot more of our world is due to chance than we realize, cognitive biases obscure our ability to observe reality objectively and many of our 'safe bets' are far riskier than we assume. 

## Determinism, Free Will, Skill and Luck 

I'm fascinated by the interplay of determinism and free will as well as the relationship between skill and luck. I tend to think that our present reality is *mostly* conditioned by previous events, but we probably do have brief flashes of *freer* will.
