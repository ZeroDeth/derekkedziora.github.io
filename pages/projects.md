My main job is editing marketing materials for an IT company. I do side projects for a bit of variety and to keep my teaching skills sharp.  

## Teaching 

[Lessons for Advanced Groups][0]: ongoing lessons for advanced students interested in professional topics. 

[Discussion Topics][1]: forty lessons that I've used with students in the past. 

[Contact me][2] if you're interested in joining one of my English groups or individual lessons. 

## Editing and Translating 

I also edit, write and do Russian to English translations.
