Now that I'm a full-time editor, my plate is mostly full. I'm still interested in the occasional freelance gig, though.  

## Teaching 

I'm a [CELTA][0] certified teacher with classroom experience in Ukraine, China and Saudi Arabia.  

I teach one advanced group and work with individual students for specific tasks such as interviews or writing assignments. 

My goal with the advanced group is to delve deeper into topics and focus more on reflection and writing than a traditional language classroom would allow. Here is our [lesson page][1]. 

My [lesson archive][2] page has forty discussion topics that I used as lessons during 2016. 

## Editing, Writing and Translating 

I also edit, write and translate (Russian to English). Contact me if you are interested in these services. 

## My Full CV 

You can view my full CV [online][3] or download it as a [PDF][4].
