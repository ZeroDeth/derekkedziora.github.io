## Copyright

I’m not a fan of copyright, therefore I release all the content on this site to the public domain under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">creative commons zero license</a>

This blog is created using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a>. I’m heavily indebted to <a href="http://jekyll.tips" target="_blank">Jekyll Casts</a> for clearly explaining how to use jekyll. You can view <a href="https://github.com/derekkedziora/derekkedziora.github.io" target="_blank">my code on github</a>. Feel free to fork this site and use it as a starting point for your own blog.

## Metrics and Data

I use basic analytics (yandex and clicky) to get ideas for improving content.

## Affiliate Links

I don’t run any ads, because I think the old advertising model is an ugly dinosaur.

I use Amazon affiliate links. If you’d like to support the creation of my more content, you can shop via these links. If I recommend a book, it’s because I’ve read it and found it useful.
