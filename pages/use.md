## Tech 

[Byword][0] is my favorite text editor for writing content in markdown. 

The [Hemingway Editor][1] is a useful tool for attacking bloated prose. The main drawback is that it only works with fairly simple writing.  

[Atom][2] is my go to editor for coding. 

[ProtonMail][3] offers solid email and a good VPN.  

## Lifestyle Stuff 

Get a standing desk. Seriously. It makes a full day in the office almost enjoyable. [Kelly Starrett's talk about standing desks][4] gives a decent overview. 

## Things I don't Use

Social media. Instead I've put more effort into cultivating intentional relationships and have found it far more rewarding. There's nothing wrong with using technology to keep it touch and schedule a call with friends and family on the other side of the planet. I find the problem is that social media lets you get away with passive and half-assed relationships.
