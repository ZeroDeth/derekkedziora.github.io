Here's what I read on a day to day basis, like ye olde blog roll from the days of old. For my all-time favorite reads, see my [book list][0].

## News

Getting out of the constant news cycle has made me far more relaxed and sane. Now I blithely miss out on the latest fake news crises.

The New York Times [daily email][1] provides more than enough information each morning in a five-minute read.

I read most of [the Economist][2] each week for in-depth coverage.


## Blogs and Podcasts

Although irredeemably hokey at times, [the Art of Manliness][3] offers some great content and insightful podcasts.

Cal Newport's blog, [Study Hacks][4], is a voice crying out in the wilderness against the culture of distraction and frivolity.

[Mr. Money Mustache][5] is another prophetic voice against decadence and an advocate for frugality. This isn't just tightening your belt for no reason; the goal is great financial independence so you can live a more meaningful life. 

Who doesn't like some dorky illustrations to go along with some really serious ideas? [Wait by why][6] delivers. 

I enjoy following [Ryan Holiday][7] - he puts out a good mix of stoicism, common sense and sceptical social commentary.
