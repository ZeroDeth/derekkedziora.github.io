### Copyright

I’m not a fan of copyright, therefore I release all the content on this site to the public domain under the [creative commons zero license][0]

This blog is created using [Jekyll][1] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][2]. You can view [my code on GitHub][3]. Feel free to fork this site and use it as a template for your own blog.

### Metrics and Data

I use basic Yandex and Clicky analytics. Knowing what search terms bring people to site and which pages are popular help me produce better content. Ghostery and similar extensions block analytics; use one of them if you don't want me to track you.

### Affiliate Links

I don’t run any ads, because the old advertising model is an ugly dinosaur. That said, I find affiliate links to be a decent compromise. I hope the future monetization of the web is one of affiliate linking, freemium products and subscription services rather than clickbait ads under the current Google and Facebook scheme.

If I post an affiliate link, it's because I genuinely use and like the product. You can support my blog by shopping with these links:

- [Amazon][4]
- [TunnelBear][5]
