We are moving forward with our calling campaign. As a result, we've set up an appointment via phone with James Smith Owner Place For Guys who was eager to speak with a FS “first thing in the morning” on Monday at 9 am ET, so all the necessary information was sent to NEF sales team.

The number of delivered emails on Thursday was 815. We were able to contact 170 prospects via Outreach. The reply rate and  the open rate has decreased (4.12% and 20.86%). This can be explained by the fact that we are contacting prospects from all waves via phone. Unfortunately, most of the replies are still negative. The most common answers are : “ Not interested” or “ Unsubscribe”.For some reason prospects are not willing to give us a feedback. We are following up with those emails, which are not “ Unsubscribe”.

The list of prospects who requested ‘Unsubscribe” can be found here.

The total number of calls made was 120. The number of prospects (decision makers) reached over the phone is 12. We are trying out different approaches to engage prospects into conversation. We've been receiving more voicemails from prospects we left messages with our contact information.

We are calling prospects for the third and fourth time, choosing different times of the day to increase chances to reach them. As a result, on a third call, Heath April promised to
(President and CEO F&G Distributors The Wonderful Frontyard Store) respond with an email address of an appropriate person to contact for this matter at his company and he did replied yesterday. We were also able to engage some of the DM's in conversation but they were too busy and asked to email them more information or call back. We will continue trying to reach more decision-makers to let them know about the service our company provides.

The percentage of rejections of the total calls is about 10.00 % ( 12 negative replies), but we are going to continue calling the new leads and following up with those who were unavailable or asked for a call back.

This week our bounce rate is 1.0%, this is the lowest rate among all of our campaign. We are still receiving a large amount of auto replies because many prospects are out of their offices on business trips. This week we launched the follow-up  process for those prospects who opened our emails but never replied back. I haven't received any feedback on these messages, though will keep sending them out, aiming to get any positive output.
