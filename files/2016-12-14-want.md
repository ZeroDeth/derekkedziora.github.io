*Original:*    
PDFfiller is used by at academic institutions throughout the world including Harvard, MIT, and Oxford to facilitate collaboration between professors, researchers, and students, and to expedite the workflow of administrative staff.

*Edited:*

*Original:*  
Settling into a new home and new university, Wang found himself without access to the requisite devices and with the need to transfer documents quickly all over the world. So, a traditional, paper-based solution was not ideal.
