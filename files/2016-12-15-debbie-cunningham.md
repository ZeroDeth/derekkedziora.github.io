title: Going Paperless in Real Estate and Insurance
---

## {{page.title}}

Debbie Cunningham runs her own insurance and real estate company, Cunningham and Associates [link to site], and faced many of the same paperwork problems that other small businesses have to contend with. When Debbie first reached out to us, here are the issues she needed PDFfiller to solve:

- Serving clients with paper based documents across a huge state like Texas was slow and inefficient 
- She was losing time and money due to bad handwriting
- Standard email and messaging doesn't always meet federal privacy and encryption laws for medical documents 

Doing business the old fashioned way - with a pen and paper - just wasn't working anymore. Luckily, Debbie found PDFfiller and realized that she could easily solve all of these problems with a single easy to use app. 

Cunningham told us: 

<blockquote>I’m working with a trucking company and they have employees that could be anywhere at any time, so getting a paper document to those folks is difficult sometimes.”</blockquote>

Now her clients can hop on their phone to digitally sign their insurance forms instead of using an expensive and time consuming courier to deliver papers that have been filled out by hand. The old issue of 90% of these papers containing illegible portions that can lead to costly mistakes has simply disappeared. 

The company also deals with sensitive documents for medical insurance. PDFfiller makes it a breeze to safely and securely send these electronically. This avoids all sorts of possible ethical and liability headaches for the businesses that Cunningham works with. 

Besides solving these problems for Cunningham and Associates, PDFfiller provided some extra solutions. PDFfiller has freed Debbie's employees to focus on growing the business rather than spending hours and hours on transcribing forms. 

In Debbie's words: 

<blockquote>"Wow, this is really pretty easy. [PDFfiller] just opened up a whole world of usability to access all those documents that we use over and over and over."</blockquote>

That's what PDFfiller offers. We'll simplify your business processes by making it possible to go paperless. This means you can focus on your business rather than worrying about the security of medical documents, collecting paper signitures or losing time and money because of you couldn't read somebody's handwritting.
