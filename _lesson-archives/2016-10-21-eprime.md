## Main Activity

[Robert Anton Wilson][2] helped popularize the idea of English Prime, which removes the verb "to be" from standard English.

- What would change in the organization of ideas and thinking upon the removal of "to be" from your language?

The main benefit that Wilson and others see from using English Prime comes from the now stark contrast between absolute truth and subjective experience.

Standard English: *Coffee is wonderful.*  
English Prime: *I enjoy drinking coffee.*

Even Hamlet could have improved the clarity of his monologue:  

> To live or to die,  
I ask myself this.

- In what cases do you think authors and speakers would find this approach useful?
- When would users of the language find this too cumbersome to use?
