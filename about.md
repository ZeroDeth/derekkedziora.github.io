**My CV:** <a href="/cv" target ="_blank">[web]</a> <a href="/files/derek_cv.pdf" target ="_blank">[pdf]</a>

**Background**  
I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona but have mostly lived and worked abroad since 2008. This includes stints in Kyrgyzstan, China and Saudi Arabia, although I've spent the bulk of this time in Ukraine.

I'm interested in and structure my classes around linguistics, business, management, technology, the IT industry, social issues, minimalism, philosophy, health and personal development.     

What follows below is a working manifesto:

**Learning Computational Thinking and Programming**  
I'm working through <u>An Introduction to Formal Logic</u> by Peter Smith with <u>The Foundations of Mathematics</u> by Ian Steward and David Tall next in line. Coming from a background in the humanities, this was terrifying for me. Now I've come to realize that cleaning up my thinking and presenting information in class under the influence of formal logic has improved my teaching. "It just sounds better" ought to be an explanation of last resort rather than my default answer to questions without a straightforward answer. Learning to unravel the complex [<code>if...then...</code>] structures of natural language and present the logic in a way that students can use has been a boon to my teaching. In any case, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity" target="_blank">mathematical maturity</a> is useful, even for those in the humanities.

I've coded this site myself. I'd like to become proficient enough in HTML and CSS to move beyond the vulgarity of coping and pasting everything. 

My long-term goal is to use computational linguistics as a tool for my students. For now, I use tools such as <a href="http://www.netspeak.org" target="_blank">netspeak.org</a> to help students with collocations or using more natural sounding lexical items. *<a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing with Python</a>* is what I eventually plan to work through to create some writing tools. For instance, if you create a text and the frequency of modal verbs dramatically differs from texts from a target corpus this could let you know where to focus your studies.

To be continued...
