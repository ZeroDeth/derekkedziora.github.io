This is my first attempt to create my own website to combine blogging and hosting content for my lessons. It is still rough around the edges and is far from a finished product. 

I started by taking the initial code from [Jonathan McGlone's demo](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) but have since changed quite a bit. The code from the tag page was taken from [Christian Specht](https://christianspecht.de/2014/10/25/separate-pages-per-tag-category-with-jekyll-without-plugins/). 

I'm a firm believer in open sourcing things, hence I release all of the content and code created for this site to the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero license.
